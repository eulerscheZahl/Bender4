            You are given a maze with a starting and target point. Find a path through the maze. There are magnetic fields on some cells that have to be avoided. You can turn them off by hitting the corresponding switch.

            <br><br>
            <strong>Switches</strong> <br> A switch has a location of it's own as well as a location of the magnetic field it controls. Each time Bender enters the cell of the switch, he will toggle the state of the magnetic field, turning it on and off.

            <br><br>
            <strong>Garbage balls</strong> <br> A garbage ball is a movable wall. Bender can move them by walking into them, if there is no wall or another garbage ball behind. If he pushes a garbage ball on a switch, it will toggle the switch. If he pushes a garbage ball on Fry, it will squash Fry
            and kill him.

            <br><br>
            <strong>Movement</strong> <br> Bender can go in the four directions
            <const>UP</const>,
            <const>DOWN</const>,
            <const>RIGHT</const> and
            <const>LEFT</const>. In case he hits a wall, he just stays at the current position. An active magnetic field erases his entire harddisc.

            <br><br>
            <strong>Functions</strong> <br> To encode the path more efficently, you can define functions as sequences of moves. Functions can call other functions as well as themselves. Functions will be executed char by char. When there is no more char
            left in the called function, the program will resume in the caller function, after the function call that was just performed.
