        Bender wants to visit his friend Fry to drink some beer. Unfortunately he's stuck in a maze and professor Farnsworth is experimenting with magnetic fields that Bender doesn't want to enter. Help Bender by giving him a plan how to escape the
        maze - but beware: because of
        his movie

            Help Bender to find a path to a given point inside the maze. Compress the path as much as possible. There are switches on the ground that Bender will toggle by entering their cell. These switches make other fields passable or impassable.

            <span>Rules</span>
        </h2>
        <div class="statement-rules-content">
            You are given a maze with a starting and target point. Find a path through the maze. There are magnetic fields on some cells that have to be avoided. You can turn them off by hitting the corresponding switch.

            <br><br>
            <strong>Coordinate system</strong> <br>
            The top-left corner has position (0,0). <var>x</var> goes to the right, <var>y</var> increases downwards.

            <br><br>
            <strong>Switches</strong> <br> A switch has a location of its own as well as a location of the magnetic field it controls. Each time Bender enters the cell of the switch, he will toggle the state of the magnetic field, turning it on and
            off.

            <br><br>
            <strong>Garbage balls</strong> <br> A garbage ball is a movable wall. Bender can move them by walking into them, if there is no wall or another garbage ball behind. If he pushes a garbage ball on a switch, it will toggle the switch. If
            he pushes a garbage ball on Fry, it will squash Fry
            and kill him.

            <br><br>
            <strong>Movement</strong> <br> Bender can go in the four directions
            <const>UP</const>,
            <const>DOWN</const>,
            <const>RIGHT</const> and
            <const>LEFT</const>. In case he hits a wall, he just stays at the current position. An active magnetic field erases his entire harddisc.

            <br><br>
            <strong>Functions</strong> <br> To encode the path more efficently, you can define functions as sequences of moves. Functions can call other functions as well as themselves. Functions will be executed char by char. When there is no more
            char
            left in the called function, the program will resume in the caller function, after the function call that was just performed.
